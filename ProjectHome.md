**Introduction**

With the Bitmap classes in Flash Player 9, developers now have the ability to utilize blitting and double-buffering techniques to create resource efficient gaming engines in the Flash Player. Diesel is a set of ActionScript 3 classes that provide a conveinent display engine to take advantage of these new player features.

**Why should I care?**

Diesel uses 1 bitmap to draw to vs. hundreds of MovieClips / Sprites. This results in a more scaleable engine, allowing for more moving sprites, lower usage of RAM & Processor, and better refresh rates.
